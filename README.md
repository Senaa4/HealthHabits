Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition

The main objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of obesity by evaluating a dataset that includes food, lifestyle, and health data from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. By utilizing Python for data science, this study highlights the use of data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sophisticated visualizations, and machine learning algorithms.

The dataset, which includes 2111 records and 17 features, covers a variety of characteristics like anthropometric measurements, dietary patterns, and lifestyle decisions. The goal variable, which divides people into seven different categories of obesity Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III is predicted by analyzing these characteristics. The project's main objective is to identify the major causes of obesity and create predictive models that can precisely categorize people into their appropriate obesity levels.

Comprehensive data pretreatment procedures, such as managing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling continuous features, were used to accomplish this. Using boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and descriptive statistics, the EDA method investigated the associations between variables and provided important new information about the distributions and patterns in the dataset. The most important predictors of obesity were further highlighted by advanced visualizations such as pair plots and feature significance plots.

Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were used to classify obesity levels. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model, in particular, demonstrated robust performance, effectively capturing non-linear relationships and handling class imbalances.
